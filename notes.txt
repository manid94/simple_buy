sudo apt update
sudo apt install screen


Start a new screen session:
    screen -S mysession

    python3 main.py

Detach from the screen session (this keeps the session and the script running in the background):

    Press Ctrl + A, then press D.


Reattach to the screen session (if you want to see your script's progress later):

    screen -r mysession
