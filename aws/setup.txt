how to connect with putty
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To connect to your AWS EC2 instance using PuTTY, follow these steps:

1. Download PuTTY and PuTTYgen
If you don’t already have PuTTY, download both PuTTY and PuTTYgen (a key generator) from their respective websites.
2. Convert .pem Key to .ppk Format
AWS provides your SSH key in .pem format, which PuTTY doesn’t directly accept. Convert it to .ppk format using PuTTYgen.
Here’s how:

Open PuTTYgen.
Click Load and select your .pem file (make sure to select “All Files” in the file type dropdown to see your .pem).
Once loaded, click Save private key and save it as a .ppk file. You can skip the passphrase for simplicity, though adding one is more secure.
3. Set Up PuTTY Connection
Open PuTTY.
In the Host Name (or IP address) field, enter the public IP address or DNS of your EC2 instance (found in the AWS EC2 Console under your instance details).
Set the Port to 22.
Under the Connection -> SSH -> Auth section, click Browse next to “Private key file for authentication” and select your .ppk file.
4. Start the Session
In PuTTY’s Session section, save your session with a name if you want to use it again.
Click Open to initiate the connection.
A security alert may pop up the first time you connect. Click Yes to continue.
Once the terminal opens, log in with the username:
For Ubuntu instances, use ubuntu.
For Amazon Linux, use ec2-user.
You should now be connected to your EC2 instance via PuTTY! From here, you can navigate and manage your server as needed.

Putty fatal error
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A "PuTTY Fatal Error" typically means there’s an issue with the connection or configuration. Here are some common reasons for this error and how to fix them:

1. Check the Security Group Settings
Ensure the security group for your EC2 instance allows inbound traffic on port 22 for SSH.
In the AWS EC2 Console, select your instance, go to Security Groups > Inbound rules, and verify there’s an entry for Type: SSH, Port: 22, with your IP address or a range that includes it (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 if you’re troubleshooting, though more restrictive IP settings are recommended for security).
2. Verify Instance State
Confirm that your EC2 instance is in the running state. If it’s in any other state, such as "stopped," start it first.
3. Check the Public IP or DNS
Ensure you are using the correct public IP address or public DNS for your instance.
If your instance’s IP has changed (such as after stopping and restarting), you’ll need to update the IP in PuTTY.
4. Convert the Private Key Correctly
If you converted your .pem key to .ppk format, double-check that it’s the correct key and that the conversion was done accurately.
You might also try regenerating the .ppk file by reopening the .pem in PuTTYgen and saving a new .ppk file.
5. Username Issues
Ensure you’re using the correct username in PuTTY:
Ubuntu instances: ubuntu
Amazon Linux: ec2-user
CentOS: centos
RHEL: ec2-user
In the Session > Host Name field, specify the username along with the IP like so:
bash
Copy code
ubuntu@your-instance-public-dns
6. Network Connectivity Issues
Sometimes, network issues or firewalls on your end can block SSH connections. You can:
Try rebooting your local router.
Check if your firewall or antivirus settings are blocking port 22.
7. Instance Configuration (IPv6)
If your instance is configured for IPv6 instead of IPv4, check that PuTTY is set to connect via IPv6, or update your connection settings accordingly.
Let me know if you need help with any of these specific steps!






You said:
not supported authentication methods available(server sent : publik key)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The "No supported authentication methods available" error usually indicates an issue with the authentication setup for SSH. This often happens when the server expects a public key for authentication, but PuTTY is not configured correctly to provide it. Here’s how to troubleshoot and resolve it:

1. Verify Your Private Key Configuration
In PuTTY, make sure the correct .ppk private key file is selected.
Go to Connection -> SSH -> Auth in PuTTY, and under "Private key file for authentication," click Browse to locate and select your .ppk file (the file you converted from your original .pem using PuTTYgen).
2. Ensure the Correct Username
AWS EC2 instances require specific usernames for login. Make sure you’re using the correct username based on your instance type:
Ubuntu: ubuntu
Amazon Linux: ec2-user
CentOS: centos
RHEL: ec2-user
You can enter the username directly in PuTTY’s Host Name (or IP address) field as follows:

bash
Copy code
ubuntu@your-instance-public-dns
3. Verify Security Group Settings
Go to your AWS EC2 Console, select the instance, and check the Security Groups to ensure inbound rules allow SSH (port 22).
Make sure your IP address is whitelisted for SSH access (you can use 0.0.0.0/0 temporarily for testing).
4. Convert the Key Again (if needed)
Sometimes, the .ppk key file may not have been saved properly. Open PuTTYgen, load your .pem file again, and save the private key as a .ppk file.
Select the new .ppk file in PuTTY.
5. Try Rebooting the EC2 Instance
If you recently made changes to the instance settings or key pairs, try restarting the instance from the AWS Console.
6. Alternative: Test with Another SSH Client
If PuTTY still doesn’t work, try using an alternative client (such as OpenSSH on Linux/Mac or Windows Terminal on Windows 10+). Run this command:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "path-to-your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-instance-public-dns
These steps should help resolve the issue! Let me know if you encounter any further challenges.

The execution role you provide must allow AWS EventBridge Scheduler to assume the role.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error message you're seeing indicates that AWS EventBridge Scheduler (formerly CloudWatch Events) doesn’t have permission to assume the role you created. You’ll need to update the IAM role's trust relationship to allow EventBridge Scheduler to assume it.

Here’s how to modify the trust relationship for your Lambda execution role:

Step 1: Modify the Trust Relationship of the IAM Role
Go to the IAM Console: IAM Console.
Under Roles, find and select the role you created for Lambda (e.g., Lambda_EC2_StartStop_Role).
In the Trust relationships tab, click Edit trust relationship.
Replace the existing JSON policy with the following JSON, which allows both Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler to assume the role:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "lambda.amazonaws.com",
          "scheduler.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Click Update Trust Policy.
This updated trust relationship allows EventBridge Scheduler (previously CloudWatch Events) to assume the role and trigger the Lambda functions.

Step 2: Test the Setup
After updating the trust relationship, try creating the EventBridge Scheduler rule again to verify it now recognizes the role. This should allow your scheduled events to start and stop the instance as intended.

Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you encounter any other difficulties!

whwere is Crontab
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The crontab (cron table) is a configuration file in Unix-like operating systems where you can schedule tasks to run automatically at specified intervals. Each user on the system has their own crontab file, which can be accessed and edited using the crontab command.

Here’s how to access and use crontab on your AWS Linux instance:

Accessing Crontab
Edit the Crontab File

To edit your crontab, run:
bash
Copy code
crontab -e
This opens the user’s crontab in the default text editor (usually nano on AWS Linux).
List Scheduled Cron Jobs

To see what cron jobs are currently scheduled for your user, use:
bash
Copy code
crontab -l
Remove All Cron Jobs

If you need to remove all entries in the crontab, use:
bash
Copy code
crontab -r
System-Wide Crontab
If you need to access the system-wide crontab (used for scheduling system tasks), it is typically located at /etc/crontab. However, it requires root permissions to edit:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/crontab
User crontabs and the system-wide crontab work similarly, but each has its own set of scheduled jobs. Let me know if you have questions about specific cron job configurations!

hoe to setup crontab when instance is started
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To automatically set up a cron job to run every time your AWS instance starts, you can use the instance's user data script or system-level initialization. Here’s a guide to configure cron to run your Python project when the instance starts:

Method 1: Use @reboot in Crontab
The @reboot directive in cron allows a job to run every time the instance starts. Here’s how to set it up:

Edit the Crontab:

Open the crontab editor:
bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add the Reboot Command:

Add a line with @reboot to run your start script every time the instance reboots or starts:
bash
Copy code
@reboot /path/to/your/project/start_project.sh
Ensure that /path/to/your/project/start_project.sh is the full path to your script, and that the script is executable.
Save and Exit:

Save and close the crontab file (in nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, and Enter).
Method 2: Use EC2 User Data Script (One-Time Setup)
You can configure a user data script that runs once when the instance is launched or rebooted. This is helpful if you need a one-time setup when launching the instance.

Edit User Data in the EC2 Console:

Stop your instance (if it’s running) from the EC2 Console.
With the instance stopped, go to Actions > Instance Settings > Edit User Data.
Add the User Data Script:

Add the following user data script to run your start script every time the instance starts:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/your/project
./start_project.sh
Make sure the path is correct and matches your project’s directory.
Restart the Instance:

Start the instance again, and the user data script will execute the start script when the instance starts.
Method 3: Use rc.local (System-Level Startup)
On AWS Linux, you can use the /etc/rc.local file to run scripts on startup.

Edit the rc.local File:

Open the file with root permissions:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

How connect ec2 with private dns
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To connect to an EC2 instance using its private DNS, you need to ensure that your network setup allows for private IP connections. Here’s how to connect to your EC2 instance using its private DNS.

Requirements
Both instances should be in the same VPC (if connecting from another EC2 instance).
Ensure security group rules allow inbound SSH (port 22) from the source instance or network.
Use a VPN or Direct Connect (if you’re connecting from your on-premises network to the private DNS in AWS).
Steps to Connect
Option 1: Connect from Another EC2 Instance in the Same VPC
SSH into the First Instance (Public or Bastion Host):

If you have an instance with a public IP or a bastion host in the same VPC, SSH into it first:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@public-ip-of-bastion-host
Connect to the Target Instance Using the Private DNS:

Once inside the bastion host, SSH to the target instance using its private DNS or private IP:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@private-dns-of-target-instance
Replace your-key.pem with your SSH key, and private-dns-of-target-instance with the target instance’s private DNS.
Option 2: Connect Directly Within a VPC Using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (if no public access is available)
Configure IAM Role for Systems Manager:

Attach the AmazonEC2RoleforSSM policy to your instance’s IAM role.
Install SSM Agent (if not pre-installed):

Most Amazon Linux and Ubuntu instances come with the SSM agent pre-installed. If not, install it using:
bash
Copy code
# For Amazon Linux
sudo yum install -y amazon-ssm-agent

# For Ubuntu
sudo snap install amazon-ssm-agent
Use AWS Systems Manager to Connect:

In the AWS Console, go to Systems Manager > Session Manager.
Start a new session with your instance. This lets you connect without SSH access by using the private DNS automatically.
Option 3: Connect Using a VPN or AWS Direct Connect (from On-Premises Network)
Set Up a VPN or Direct Connect to your AWS VPC.
Connect Using Private DNS:
Once your on-premises network is connected to your VPC, you can SSH into the instance using its private DNS:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@private-dns-of-instance
These steps should help you access your instance using its private DNS in different scenarios. Let me know if you need further details on any particular method!






You said:
How connect ec2 in private dns
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To connect to an EC2 instance using its private DNS, the instance needs to be in a private subnet (i.e., it has no public IP address), and you'll need to connect from either another EC2 instance within the same VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) or from a network connected to the VPC via VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Below are some methods to connect to your private EC2 instance using its private DNS.

Option 1: Connect via a Bastion Host (Jump Box)
Set Up a Bastion Host:

Launch another EC2 instance (Bastion Host) in a public subnet with a public IP and SSH access.
Ensure the bastion host’s security group allows inbound SSH (port 22) from your IP address.
Ensure the private instance’s security group allows SSH (port 22) from the bastion host’s private IP address or security group.
SSH into the Bastion Host:

SSH into the bastion host using its public IP:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@public-ip-of-bastion-host
Replace "your-key.pem" with your SSH key and public-ip-of-bastion-host with the actual public IP address of the bastion host.
SSH from the Bastion Host to the Private Instance:

Once connected to the bastion host, SSH into the private instance using its private DNS or private IP:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@private-dns-of-target-instance
Ensure your SSH key is available on the bastion host, or use an SSH agent to forward the key.
Option 2: Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (No Bastion Host Needed)
Attach an IAM Role to the Private Instance:

Attach an IAM role with the AmazonEC2RoleforSSM or AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to your private instance.
Install the SSM Agent (if needed):

Most modern Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Ubuntu AMIs come with the SSM agent pre-installed. If not, install it using:
bash
Copy code
# For Amazon Linux
sudo yum install -y amazon-ssm-agent

# For Ubuntu
sudo snap install amazon-ssm-agent
Start the SSM agent (if it’s not running):
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
Use Session Manager to Connect:

Go to the AWS Systems Manager Console > Session Manager.
Find your instance and start a new session. This will open a browser-based shell, allowing you to manage the instance securely without SSH or a public IP.
Option 3: Connect from an On-Premises Network Using VPN or Direct Connect
Set Up a VPN or AWS Direct Connect to establish a private connection between your on-premises network and the AWS VPC.

SSH Directly Using Private DNS:

Once the VPN or Direct Connect is configured, you can SSH to the instance directly using its private DNS:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@private-dns-of-instance
Replace "your-key.pem" with your private key and private-dns-of-instance with the private DNS of the EC2 instance.
Each method above enables access to your private instance in different network configurations. Let me know if you need more details on a specific approach!

If your AWS EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch) scheduler is not triggering your Lambda function, here are some troubleshooting steps to help identify and resolve the issue:

1. Verify the Schedule Rule in EventBridge
Go to the EventBridge Console: EventBridge Console.
Select Rules and find the rule you created for your scheduled task.
Check the State:
Make sure the rule’s state is enabled. If it is disabled, enable it by selecting the rule and choosing Actions > Enable.
Verify the Schedule Expression:
Ensure the cron or rate expression is correct. For example:
Rate expression: rate(5 minutes) for every 5 minutes.
Cron expression: cron(45 8 ? * MON-FRI *) for 8:45 AM, Monday to Friday.
Check the Target:
Confirm that the rule's target is set to the correct Lambda function and that the function exists.
2. Verify Lambda Permissions
Go to the IAM Console and find the execution role associated with your Lambda function.
Ensure the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and CloudWatchEventsFullAccess policies are attached to the role, allowing EventBridge to trigger the function and Lambda to write logs to CloudWatch.
3. Check CloudWatch Logs for Errors
Go to the CloudWatch Console > Logs.
Look for logs under the /aws/lambda/your-function-name log group.
Review the logs for any error messages. If the function is not triggered, there might be an error with permissions or the function itself.
4. Test the Rule Manually
Manually Trigger the Rule:
Go to the Lambda Console and manually test your function by clicking Test. This will help verify if the issue is with the Lambda function or the EventBridge rule itself.
5. Test the Rule with a Different Frequency (for Debugging)
Modify the EventBridge rule to run every minute temporarily using rate(1 minute).
Monitor CloudWatch Logs to see if the function is triggered.
Once tested, revert to the original schedule.
6. Use AWS CloudTrail for More Debugging (Optional)
If none of the above steps work, you can enable AWS CloudTrail to track EventBridge actions and see if there are any blocked requests or errors.

These steps should help troubleshoot why your EventBridge scheduler isn’t working as expected. Let me know if you need more detailed help on any of these steps!

    return 'Instance stopped'
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your Lambda function code for stopping an EC2 instance looks correct. Here’s a quick checklist to ensure it works as expected:

1. Verify IAM Permissions
Ensure the Lambda function's execution role has permission to stop EC2 instances:

Go to the IAM Console and find the IAM role associated with your Lambda function.
Attach the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy, or create a custom policy with permissions like this:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:StopInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-06d946678bcada8d7"

To ensure reliable operation, consider adding error handling in case the instance is already stopped or there’s an issue with permissions:

python
Copy code
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    try:
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-06d946678bcada8d7'])
        return 'Instance stopped'
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error stopping instance: {e}"
This setup should allow you to confirm the Lambda function is correctly stopping the instance. Let me know if you need further help!

If your Lambda function to stop the EC2 instance isn’t working as expected, here are a few steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check Lambda Permissions
Make sure the Lambda execution role has permissions to stop EC2 instances.

Go to the IAM Console > Roles.

Find the Lambda execution role for your function.

Verify that the role has either AmazonEC2FullAccess or a custom policy that includes ec2:StopInstances permissions.

You can attach the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy temporarily for troubleshooting.

2. Verify EC2 Instance ID and State
Make sure:

The Instance ID is correct. Double-check that i-06d946678bcada8d7 is the correct ID for your instance.
The instance is in the running state, as stop_instances won’t affect instances that are already stopped.
3. Check CloudWatch Logs for Errors
Go to the CloudWatch Console > Logs > Log groups.
Open the log group for your Lambda function (typically named /aws/lambda/your-function-name).
Look for any error messages in the logs. Common errors might include permissions issues, instance state, or other issues with the AWS SDK.
4. Add Detailed Logging to Your Lambda Function
To capture more specific error details, you can add logging to the function:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import logging

# Set up logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    instance_id = 'i-06d946678bcada8d7'
    
    try:
        # Log instance ID and attempt to stop
        logger.info(f"Attempting to stop instance {instance_id}")
        
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        logger.info(f"Stop instance response: {response}")
        
        return 'Instance stopped'
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error stopping instance: {e}")
        return f"Error stopping instance: {e}"
5. Test the Lambda Function
In the Lambda Console, test the function to trigger it manually.
After testing, go back to CloudWatch Logs to review the output and any errors captured.
6. Verify EC2 and Region Configuration
Ensure that the Lambda function is running in the same region as your EC2 instance. If the EC2 instance is in a different region, modify the boto3 client to specify the correct region:

python
Copy code
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='your-instance-region')
7. Verify VPC Configuration (If Applicable)
If your Lambda function is configured to run in a specific VPC, make sure it has network access to the EC2 instance (e.g., proper VPC and subnet configuration).

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, let me know the specific error you’re seeing in CloudWatch Logs, and I can help troubleshoot further.

}
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error message indicates that your Lambda function is timing out because it is exceeding the default 3-second execution limit. To resolve this, you’ll need to increase the timeout setting for the Lambda function.

Here’s how to increase the timeout:

Step 1: Increase Lambda Timeout
Go to the AWS Lambda Console: Lambda Console.
Select your Lambda function.
In the Configuration tab, click on General configuration.
Click Edit.
Set the Timeout to a higher value (e.g., 10 seconds or more, depending on your requirements).
Click Save.
Step 2: Test the Function Again
After increasing the timeout, try running the function again. This should give your function enough time to complete the stop_instances request to EC2.

Step 3: Add Logging (Optional)
To help identify any further delays, you can add logging statements to monitor the time taken by each part of the function:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import logging
from time import time

# Set up logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    start_time = time()
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    instance_id = 'i-06d946678bcada8d7'
    
    try:
        logger.info(f"Attempting to stop instance {instance_id} at {start_time}")
        
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        
        end_time = time()
        logger.info(f"Stop instance response: {response}")
        logger.info(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        
        return 'Instance stopped'
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error stopping instance: {e}")
        return f"Error stopping instance: {e}"
With the increased timeout, your function should now complete without timing out. Let me know if you encounter any additional issues!

  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:StartInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-06d946678bcada8d7"
    }
  ]
}
Replace region and account-id with your AWS region and account ID.
2. Verify EC2 Instance ID and State
Double-check that i-06d946678bcada8d7 is the correct instance ID.
Ensure the instance is in the stopped state; start_instances won’t work if the instance is already running.
3. Add Logging to Confirm Execution
Add logging to confirm the function's execution and capture any errors:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import logging

# Set up logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    instance_id = 'i-06d946678bcada8d7'
    
    try:
        # Log instance ID and attempt to start
        logger.info(f"Attempting to start instance {instance_id}")
        
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        logger.info(f"Start instance response: {response}")
        
        return 'Instance started'
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error starting instance: {e}")
        return f"Error starting instance: {e}"
4. Increase Lambda Timeout (if needed)
Starting an instance may take longer than the default Lambda timeout of 3 seconds. Increase the Lambda function timeout to, say, 10 seconds:

Go to Configuration > General configuration in the Lambda Console.
Increase the Timeout to 10 seconds (or more if necessary).
5. Test the Lambda Function
In the Lambda Console, click Test and select Create new test event if needed.
After running the test, go to CloudWatch Logs and review the logs to confirm if the instance was successfully started.
6. Check EC2 Instance State
Go to the EC2 Console and confirm that the instance’s Instance State has changed to running.

These steps should help you confirm if the Lambda function is successfully starting the instance. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

        # Start the instance
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
        logger.info(f"Start instance response: {response}")
        
        return 'Instance started'
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error starting instance: {e}")
        return f"Error starting instance: {e}"
Click Deploy to save the updated code.

Step 2: Increase the Timeout
In the Configuration tab, scroll down to General configuration and click Edit.
Increase the Timeout setting to 10 seconds or more (e.g., 30 seconds if you think it may take longer).
Click Save.
Step 3: Verify IAM Role Permissions (if not yet added)
In the Execution role section, click on the IAM role associated with the function.
In the IAM Console, ensure the role has the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy or a custom policy with the ec2:StartInstances permission.
Step 4: Test the Updated Function
In the Lambda Console, click Test to execute the function.
Go to CloudWatch Logs to check the logs generated by this invocation. The logs should provide details on whether the instance started successfully or if any errors occurred.
Step 5: Verify the EC2 Instance State
Go to the EC2 Console to check the instance's state. If the Lambda function worked correctly, the instance should be in the running state.
With these updates, your Lambda function should be able to start the EC2 instance more reliably and provide detailed logs to help with troubleshooting. Let me know if you encounter any issues with this setup!

This JSON is a trust policy for an IAM role, allowing AWS Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) to assume the role. Here’s a breakdown of what it does and when you’d use it:

Explanation
Version: Specifies the policy language version.
Statement: Contains the permissions for who can assume this role and under what conditions.
Effect: "Allow" grants permissions.
Principal: Specifies the AWS services allowed to assume this role:
"lambda.amazonaws.com" allows AWS Lambda to assume the role.
"scheduler.amazonaws.com" allows AWS EventBridge Scheduler to assume the role.
Action: "sts:AssumeRole" allows the specified services to assume the role.
When to Use This Trust Policy
This trust policy is useful when:

You have a Lambda function that needs to run on a schedule set by EventBridge Scheduler (formerly CloudWatch Events).
You want both Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler to be able to assume this IAM role for tasks such as triggering your Lambda function based on a set schedule.
How to Attach the Trust Policy
Go to the IAM Console: IAM Console.
Select the Role associated with your Lambda function or the one you want both Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler to assume.
In the Trust relationships tab, click Edit trust relationship.
Replace the existing JSON with the policy you provided if it matches your requirements.
Save the changes.
This will allow both Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler to assume the role, enabling scheduled invocations of your Lambda function. Let me know if you need any additional help with this setup!

To update the IAM role's permissions to allow both starting and stopping EC2 instances, you’ll need to add an inline policy to the role in addition to the trust policy you’ve provided.

Here’s how to add this permission:

Step 1: Update the Inline Policy with EC2 Permissions
Go to the IAM Console: IAM Console.

Find and select the IAM role you’re using for your Lambda function.

In the Permissions tab, click on Add inline policy.

Use the JSON editor to add the following policy, which grants permissions to start and stop specific EC2 instances:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-06d946678bcada8d7"
    }
  ]
}
Replace region with your AWS region (e.g., us-west-2).
Replace account-id with your AWS account ID.
Replace i-06d946678bcada8d7 with your actual EC2 instance ID.
If you want to allow starting and stopping all instances in your account, you can set Resource to "*":

json
Copy code
"Resource": "*"
Click Review policy, then Save changes.

Step 2: Verify the Trust Relationship (if not already configured)
Ensure that the trust policy for the role is configured to allow Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler to assume the role. Use this JSON in the Trust relationships tab if it’s not already set up:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "lambda.amazonaws.com",
          "scheduler.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Final Check
Save the changes in IAM.
Test the Lambda function to confirm it can now start and stop the specified EC2 instance.
This setup allows your Lambda function to start and stop the instance and lets Lambda and EventBridge Scheduler assume the role when needed. Let me know if you need further assistance!

If your AWS EventBridge Scheduler (formerly CloudWatch Events) isn’t triggering your Lambda function as expected, here are some troubleshooting steps to help identify and resolve the issue:

1. Check the Schedule Rule in EventBridge
Go to the EventBridge Console: EventBridge Console.
Select Rules and locate the rule you created for your scheduled task.
Check the Rule State:
Make sure the rule’s state is enabled. If it’s disabled, enable it by selecting the rule and choosing Actions > Enable.
Verify the Schedule Expression:
Ensure the cron or rate expression is correct.
Examples:
Rate expression for every 5 minutes: rate(5 minutes)
Cron expression for 8:45 AM, Monday to Friday: cron(45 8 ? * MON-FRI *)
Check the Target:
Ensure the rule is set to the correct Lambda function.
2. Verify Lambda Permissions for EventBridge Scheduler
Go to the IAM Console > Roles and locate the execution role for your Lambda function.
Ensure the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy and CloudWatchEventsFullAccess policy are attached, which allow Lambda to write logs and EventBridge Scheduler to trigger the Lambda function.
3. Check Lambda Logs in CloudWatch
Go to the CloudWatch Console > Logs > Log groups.
Locate the log group for your Lambda function (usually /aws/lambda/your-function-name).
Review the logs for any entries related to the function invocation by EventBridge Scheduler. This can reveal if the function was triggered and if any errors occurred.
4. Test the Rule Manually
Manually Trigger the Lambda Function:
Go to the Lambda Console, select your Lambda function, and click Test to execute it.
If the Lambda function runs correctly manually, then the issue likely lies with EventBridge Scheduler settings or permissions.
5. Adjust the Schedule for Testing (Optional)
Temporarily set the EventBridge rule to run every minute (rate(1 minute)) to see if it triggers your Lambda function.
After testing, revert to your original schedule.
6. Use CloudTrail for Additional Logging (Optional)
Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture more detailed logs of actions in your account, including EventBridge rule invocations.
In CloudTrail, search for events related to Invoke actions to check if EventBridge is trying to invoke your Lambda function and if any errors are reported.
Following these steps should help identify and resolve why your EventBridge Scheduler isn’t working as expected. Let me know if you find specific errors or need more assistance!
